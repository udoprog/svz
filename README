Hi!

I was sick one day of having to do extensive testing for my running daemons in a flexible way.

Therefore i wrote this small program.

Hope you have fun with it.

usage:
  svz <if-stmt> [do <do-stmt> [else <else-stmt>]] [-- stmt ..]
  
  This is the grammar:
  
    if-stmt   := stmt
    do-stmt   := stmt
    else-stmt := stmt
    
    stmt := { stmt }
    stmt |= stmt and stmt
    stmt |= stmt or stmt
    stmt |= -<function>
    
    available <function>s are:
      pid <argument>
        TRUE if <argument> is an existing pid, otherwise FALSE
    
      echo <argument> [<argument 2> [..]] $
        Echoes all arguments, is always TRUE.
      
      exec <path> [<argument> [<argument 2> [..]]] $
        Executes <path> with argument list. Is TRUE if execution returns status 0, otherwise FALSE.
