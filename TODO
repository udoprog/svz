 - stale command which checks the following:
   . pid file does not exist - Creates pidfile and sends the last parsed pid into it, eval TRUE
   . pid file exists, pid is not running - Recreate pidfile, send last pid into it, eval TRUE
   . pid file exists, pid IS running - do nothing, eval FALSE
 - move check for existing function into supervize.c (from parser.y) (DONE)
 - use getopt for parsing options.
 - Fix proper build system.
